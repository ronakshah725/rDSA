## Overview
--------

This project is a collection of exercises and implementations of common data structures and algorithms, as well as
explorations of design principles and newer features in Java, including Virtual Threads and the Spring ecosystem.

## Goals
------

* Practice implementing common data structures and algorithms, such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal
* Explore design principles, such as SOLID and GRASP
* Learn about and experiment with newer features in Java, including Virtual Threads and the Spring ecosystem
* Improve problem-solving skills and coding abilities

## Structure
------------

This project is organized into several modules, each focusing on a specific area of study:

* **ds-datastructures**: Implementations of common data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues
* **ds-algorithms**: Implementations of common algorithms, such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal
* **oop-exampledesigns**: Examples and exercises illustrating design principles, such as SOLID and GRASP
* **java-features**: Explorations of newer features in Java, including Virtual Threads
* **spring-ecosystem**: Examples and exercises using the Spring ecosystem, including Spring Boot and Spring Cloud

## Features
---------

* Implementations of common data structures and algorithms
* Examples and exercises illustrating design principles
* Explorations of newer features in Java, including Virtual Threads
* Examples and exercises using the Spring ecosystem

## Getting Started
-----------------

To get started with this project, simply clone the repository and begin exploring the different modules.

## Requirements
--------------

* Java 17 or later
* Maven or Gradle for building and running the project
* Spring Boot and Spring Cloud for the Spring ecosystem module

## Roadmap
----------

* Continue to add new exercises and implementations of common data structures and algorithms
* Explore additional design principles and patterns
